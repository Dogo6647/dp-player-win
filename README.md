Dogo+ Player source code for Windows.
This was supposed to be used with the dogoplus.ml website to play
its content, but was later scrapped and replaced with an HTML5 web player.
This does not work with the new Dogo+ protocol for video storage.

How to install:
1. Download a release from the releases tab.
2. Extract the zip to your Downloads folder or your desktop.
3. Open the extracted folder and click on "click-to-install.bat"
4. Follow the instructions on screen.
5. If all goes well and there are no "Access denied" or "0 file(s) copied" on screen, then
Congratulations! You've succesfully installed Dogo+ Player.
6. Open your start menu and search for "DogoPlayer".
7. Click DogoPlayer. If the program works properly, you should be good to go.
